Traditional intrusion detection systems rely primarily on 2D cameras and motion sensors, which suffer from limitations such as poor performance in low-light conditions, occlusion issues, and high false alarm rates. Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) technology offers a promising alternative by providing accurate 3D spatial information regardless of lighting conditions.

LIDAR sensors generate dense point clouds that capture precise geometric information about the environment. This 3D data enables more robust object detection and classification compared to traditional 2D approaches. The integration of deep learning techniques with LIDAR data has shown remarkable success in autonomous driving applications, and similar principles can be applied to intrusion detection systems.

This paper presents a novel approach to intrusion detection using LIDAR sensors combined with the MMDetection3D framework. The system addresses the critical need for reliable, all-weather intrusion detection in sensitive areas such as military installations, critical infrastructure, and high-security facilities."""
