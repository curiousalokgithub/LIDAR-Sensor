    üéØ WHAT IS LIDAR-BASED INTRUSION DETECTION?
    ===========================================
    
    Imagine you have a security guard with super-vision who can see in 360 degrees
    and measure the exact distance to every object around them. That's what LIDAR does!
    
    üîç HOW LIDAR WORKS:
    - Sends out laser beams in all directions
    - Measures how long light takes to bounce back
    - Creates a 3D map of everything around it
    - Can detect objects up to 100+ meters away
    - Works day and night, in any weather
    
    üõ°Ô∏è FOR INTRUSION DETECTION:
    - Monitors a secured perimeter (like a fence line)
    - Detects when people, vehicles, or objects enter restricted areas
    - Classifies what type of object it detected
    - Raises alerts based on threat level
    - Tracks movement patterns
    
    üìä ADVANTAGES OVER CAMERAS:
    - Works in complete darkness
    - Not affected by weather/fog
    - Measures exact distances and sizes
    - 360-degree coverage
    - Privacy-friendly (no faces recorded)

üéØ WHAT IS LIDAR?
LIDAR = Light Detection and Ranging
- Like radar, but uses laser light instead of radio waves
- Spins around rapidly (10-20 times per second)
- Creates millions of 3D points per second
- Each point has X, Y, Z coordinates + intensity

üîç HOW DETECTION WORKS:
1. LIDAR scans the environment continuously
2. AI models analyze the point cloud data
3. Objects are identified and classified
4. Movement is tracked over time
5. Alerts are triggered for suspicious activity

üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY APPLICATIONS:
‚Ä¢ Perimeter protection for facilities
‚Ä¢ Border monitoring
‚Ä¢ Critical infrastructure protection
‚Ä¢ Parking lot security
‚Ä¢ Building entrance monitoring
